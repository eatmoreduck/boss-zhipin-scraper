A lightweight **BOSS Zhipin scraper / crawler** (a.k.a. spider) for job listings on [zhipin.com](https://www.zhipin.com). Instead of driving a heavy Selenium/Playwright browser, it connects to your **already-logged-in Chrome** via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), reuses the real session, and calls the in-page search API directly — bypassing the front-end font-based anti-scraping so you get the **plaintext salary** in every record. Output goes to JSON / CSV, plus an aggregated salary/skill analysis and a copy-paste prompt for polishing your job-application materials. Also ships as a Hermes Agent Skill.

> 📌 **In one sentence**: no Selenium/Playwright — connect to your logged-in Chrome over CDP, hit the search API with the real session, get JSON/CSV with plaintext salaries, plus salary-distribution, skill-frequency stats and a résumé-optimization prompt.

## 🚀 30-Second Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone + install deps
git clone https://github.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper.git
cd boss-zhipin-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt          # or: uv sync

# 2. Launch an isolated Chrome and log in (only once; session persists)
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome

# 3. Scrape + analyze
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海 --pages 3 --analysis

# Cities nationwide are supported (incl. tier-3/4/5), e.g.:
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --keyword "前端" --city 赣州 --pages 3
# List supported cities: --list-cities [keyword]
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --list-cities 江

# 4. Generate an aggregated summary + prompt after scraping (reads the latest result)
python3 scripts/job_summary.py
```

Right after scraping you get: salary ranges, experience requirements, top skill keywords, and a job-application optimization prompt. The prompt is based solely on the scraped job data — it never reads your local résumé file and never scores personal-job match.

## ✨ Features

- Plaintext salary (API mode, bypasses font-based obfuscation)
- Boss activity status as a separate field (`boss_active_status`): list maps `bossOnline`→"在线"; detail can provide finer labels like "刚刚活跃"
- Dual JSON / CSV output
- Detail-page JD scraping + skill analysis
- Aggregated summary + copy-paste prompt after scraping
- Incremental writes (no data loss on crash)
- One-shot environment check + persistent isolated Chrome CDP profile
- Multi-dimension filters (scale, funding, salary, experience, degree, industry)
- macOS + Linux support (a Windows code path is reserved but untested — not guaranteed to work)

<details>
<summary>🔍 Why not a Selenium / Playwright crawler?</summary>

- Selenium/Playwright spins up a full instrumented browser — it's heavy, has an obvious fingerprint, and is easily flagged by BOSS Zhipin's risk-control / CAPTCHA.
- This tool connects to your own already-logged-in Chrome (via CDP), reusing a real fingerprint and session, and calls the same legitimate search API the page uses. The `salaryDesc` it returns is already plaintext — no need to parse font-obfuscated DOM salaries.
- The result is more stable than traditional DOM-scraping crawlers and harder to flag as automated traffic.

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone then install locally (recommended)

Because `hermes skills install` may not reach GitHub directly in some environments, clone the repo first and install locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper.git
cd boss-zhipin-scraper

# 2. Copy into the Hermes skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts
cp SKILL.md ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/
cp scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/
cp scripts/job_summary.py ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/data
cp data/city_codes.json ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/data/
```

### Option 2: One-line curl install

No need to clone the whole repo — download just the files you need:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/SKILL.md && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py \
  -o ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/scripts/job_summary.py \
  -o ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/job_summary.py && \
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/data && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/data/city_codes.json \
  -o ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/data/city_codes.json
```

### Option 3: `hermes skills install` (requires direct GitHub access)

```bash
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/SKILL.md --category data-science
```

> Note: this depends on the hermes process being able to reach GitHub directly. If you hit a timeout or connection failure, use Option 1 or 2.

### Verify the installation

```bash
# Check that the files exist
ls ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/SKILL.md
ls ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py
ls ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/job_summary.py
ls ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/data/city_codes.json
```

After installing, just say in a Hermes conversation: "Search BOSS Zhipin for AI Agent jobs in Shanghai."

## Use as a CLI tool

You don't have to install it as a Skill — use it as a plain CLI:

```bash
# 1. Clone + install deps
git clone https://github.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper.git
cd boss-zhipin-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start Chrome CDP
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome
# First run won't copy your main Chrome session; log in to zhipin.com in the dedicated BOSS browser that pops up
# setup waits for login to finish and confirms the API returns plaintext salaries

# 3. Check the environment
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --check

# Optional: real browser/API smoke test (writes no result files)
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --smoke-test

# 4. Scrape
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海 --pages 3 --format csv --analysis

# 5. Summary + prompt after scraping
python3 scripts/job_summary.py --top 15
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `--keyword` | Search keyword (default "AI Agent") |
| `--city` | City (Chinese name or 9-digit code, default Shanghai). **Supports cities nationwide** (300+, incl. tier-3/4/5); city codes auto-sync from BOSS at runtime. See [`data/city_codes.json`](data/city_codes.json), or run `--list-cities`. An unrecognized city name now exits with an error instead of silently producing zero results |
| `--list-cities [keyword]` | Print the supported city list, optional keyword filter, e.g. `--list-cities 江` |
| `--pages` | Number of pages (max 10) |
| `--format` | json / csv; csv also exports list and detail CSVs |
| `--detail` | Scrape detail-page JD (on by default) |
| `--no-detail` | Do not scrape detail pages |
| `--analysis` | Analysis report |
| `--merge FILE` | Merge existing data (deduped by job_id) |
| `--allow-dom-fallback` | Allow DOM extraction fallback when the API has no data; off by default, salaries may be unreliable |
| `--check` | Environment check (CDP + deps + login state) |
| `--smoke-test` | Run one real Chrome/CDP BOSS search API smoke test, writes no result files |
| `--setup-chrome` | One-shot launch of Chrome CDP (persistent isolated profile) |
| `--copy-login-state` | Manually import the main Chrome's Local State + cookie-related files into the isolated profile (never copied by default, on first run, or on repeated runs) |
| `--reset-chrome-profile` | Rebuild the dedicated BOSS Chrome profile; clears the login state inside this dedicated browser |
| `--no-wait-login` | With `--setup-chrome`, do not wait for login to finish |
| `--login-timeout` | Seconds to wait for login under `--setup-chrome` (default 300) |
| `--stop-chrome` | Close the dedicated BOSS CDP Chrome (matched precisely by the isolated profile; never touches your main Chrome) |
| `--close-chrome` | Auto-close the dedicated Chrome after a scrape finishes normally (off by default; not triggered on errors, so the login state is kept) |
| `--output` | List output path (default `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result/`) |
| `--detail-output` | Detail output path (default `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result/`) |
| `--cdp-port` | CDP port (default 9222) |
| `--scale/--salary/--experience/--degree` | Filters |

## Post-Scrape Summary & Prompt

`scripts/job_summary.py` only reads the already-scraped `boss_jobs_*.json` and `boss_details_*.json`, does simple aggregation, and produces a copy-paste prompt. It never reads your local résumé file, pulls in no PDF dependency, and never scores a person against a job.

```bash
# Read the newest boss_jobs_*.json under the default result dir and auto-match the same-timestamp or newest detail file
python3 scripts/job_summary.py

# Specify list and detail files
python3 scripts/job_summary.py \
  --input ~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result/boss_jobs_20260625_1200.json \
  --details ~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result/boss_details_20260625_1200.json \
  --top 15

# Only emit the prompt
python3 scripts/job_summary.py --prompt-only
```

After installing the package you can also use the entry command:

```bash
uv run boss-summary --top 15
```

The summary covers: salary ranges, experience requirements, degree requirements, regional distribution, top companies, skill tags, frequent JD terms. The prompt asks the model to use these stats to fill in résumé keywords, suggest project-story rewrite directions, and produce an interview-prep checklist — while explicitly instructing it not to fabricate experience.

## How It Works

This is a Chrome-CDP-based BOSS Zhipin crawler. Core flow:

1. Connect to an already-open Chrome via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
2. Inject JS inside the BOSS Zhipin page that calls the search API via synchronous XHR
3. The API returns plaintext `salaryDesc`, bypassing the front-end font obfuscation
4. The list API preserves `securityId` / `lid` context, carried into the detail page
5. Each page is written to disk immediately, deduped by `job_id`

DOM extraction is not used for the list by default, since DOM salaries may be hit by font-based obfuscation. Only when `--allow-dom-fallback` is explicitly passed will it fall back to DOM when the API returns no data.

For detail pages, the scraper only extracts a section containing the job-description heading. Full-page `body` text is diagnostic input for detecting login walls and navigation shells and is never written directly as a JD. If the page contains the login-to-view-full-content marker, the crawl fails explicitly and stops before truncated text, recruiter metadata, company sections, or recommended jobs can be saved as a complete JD.

`--input ... --analysis --no-detail` first loads `--detail-output`, then the `boss_details_*.json` with the same timestamp in the same dir as the input list, and finally the newest detail file under `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result`.

## Chrome Profile Security Policy

`--setup-chrome` uses a persistent isolated profile by default — it neither symlinks nor copies your main Chrome data. First launch and subsequent launches only create or reuse this dedicated profile:

- `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/chrome-profile`

Without an explicit `--output` or `--detail-output`, scraping results are saved under:

- `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result`

On first use you must log in to BOSS Zhipin manually inside this dedicated Chrome. `--setup-chrome` waits for the login to finish and uses the search API to confirm it can get plaintext `salaryDesc` before returning. The session is stored inside the dedicated profile and survives reboots; re-running `--setup-chrome` does not wipe it and does not affect your main Chrome, Gmail, GitHub, or other accounts.

Each login-probe round sends one search request, rotates across keyword/city targets, and backs off from 3 seconds to at most 15 seconds. Probe requests count toward the same 500-request global budget. Logged-out sessions, empty probe samples, API restrictions, and malformed responses are reported separately. A confirmed restriction such as `code: 31` or `code: 37` ("您的环境存在异常" / abnormal environment) stops probing immediately instead of prompting for another login or continuing frequent retries. Unknown risk-control codes are also recognized as restrictions via message keywords (abnormal environment, too-frequent access, security check, etc.), so an authenticated session that is merely rate-limited is no longer misreported as a login failure.

The interactive login page opened by `--setup-chrome` is the only temporary page intentionally brought to the foreground. Temporary tabs used by environment checks, list/detail scraping, and the smoke test run in the background so automation does not repeatedly steal focus. “Background” here only means the tab is not activated; the dedicated Chrome still runs with a visible UI and can be opened manually for inspection.

If you really need to import the BOSS session from your main Chrome, run explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome --copy-login-state
```

`--copy-login-state` overwrites the corresponding cookie-related files inside the isolated profile on every run; do not pass this for daily launches. It only copies `Local State` and `Default/Cookies*`, `Default/Network/Cookies*`-style cookie database files — not password stores, history, extensions, or a full profile. To wipe the dedicated browser's login state:

```bash
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome --reset-chrome-profile
```

### Tearing down when you're done

After a scrape/analysis finishes, the dedicated Chrome is **not** closed automatically (the login state is kept by default so you can run the next scrape right away). When you're sure you no longer need it, tear it down manually:

```bash
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --stop-chrome
```

`--stop-chrome` only closes the Chrome process(es) that belong to the scraper's isolated profile (`--user-data-dir`). It **never** kills by port or process name, so it cannot accidentally take down your main Chrome, Gmail, GitHub, or other signed-in sessions.

If you'd rather have a particular scrape close the dedicated Chrome once it finishes normally, add `--close-chrome`:

```bash
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海 --pages 3 --close-chrome
```

`--close-chrome` is off by default, and it only fires on the **success path** of a completed scrape — login failures, crashes, and other early exits leave the Chrome running so the login state is preserved.
